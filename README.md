Diet-Rotten-Tomatoes
====================

A quick and dirty experiment using the Rotten Tomatoes API to see if I could speed up ratings look up.

You can see it at http://drt.adamsimpson.net

This does have the ability to search with [Launch Center Pro](http://appcubby.com/launch-center/), simply append your search query to the url like so:
`http://drt.adamsimpson.net/?movie=die hard`

Give it a shot.
