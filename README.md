Diet-Rotten-Tomatoes
====================

A quick and dirty experiment using the Rotten Tomatoes API to see if I could speed up ratings look up.

You can see it at http://asimpson.github.com/Diet-Rotten-Tomatoes

This does have the ability to search with [Launch Center Pro](http://appcubby.com/launch-center/), simply append your search query to the url like so:
`http://asimpson.github.com/Diet-Rotten-Tomatoes/#die hard`

Give it a shot.
